                    My name is Darien Miller, and I am a fourth year student here at Brooklyn College. I started in August 2015, and I will 
                    be *unfornately* graduating from here in May 2020. I am a computer science major, anime watcher, video game player, and 
                    avid bike rider! Most of my time is spent indulging in these hobbies, with recreational programming quickly becoming my
                    most invested hobby. Here are screenshots from some side projects:
